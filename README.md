# AP Computer Science

This repository includes a collection of my projects from AP Computer Science -- a course I completed in 10th grade of high school.

### Class Summary
The course emphasized the organization of information; the implementation and comparison of common data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs; and techniques of data abstraction, including encapsulation and inheritance. Furthermore, I explored recursion and the close relationship between data structures and algorithms and focused on designing, implementing, and testing object-oriented programs.

### Topics Covered
Java Overview, Object Basics, Java Classes, Code Testing, Java GUI, Arrays, Interfaces, Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Exception Handling, Object Arrays, Array Lists, Search Methods, Recursion, Object Hierarchies, Overriding, GUIs, Recursion, Interfaces, Complexity Analysis, Recursive Sort Methods, Class Diagrams and UML
